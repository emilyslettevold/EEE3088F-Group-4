The project involves the design of the power module intended for the use of a micromouse. The following files contain the circuitry for the subsections of this board. The final files can be downloaded and the schematic as well as PCB design can be seen using KiCad. The intended use of this project is to create the power subsystem that will fit into a micro-mouse. Micromouses are robots that are specfically designed to navigate through mazes through the most optimal path and quicket time. There are many competitions worldwide that race these robots to determine which is the most effcient.
